<span><p>Nomatic projects support applications which translate sensor readings
into semantic labels.   Generally this helps support a richer user interface by
giving users the option to choose concepts which are familiar to them rather
than using the language of sensor readings which are familiar to computers.</p>
<p>An example of this is labeling places with names that are meaningful to
people rather than computers.  People don't use latitude and longitude to talk
about locations, so why should computers force people to communicate in that way?</p>
<p>We call this problem the "sensors to semantics" problem.</p></span>
