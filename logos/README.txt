Logo files:
	*	EPSes are in vector format for any application where you need a scalable logo (like using it in print, or in large format). If you need a large bitmapped logo, open these in Photoshop at the required size.
	*	TIFs are uncompressed versions of the logos from the website comps. If you need a larger logo, use the EPS version.
	*	the GIFs are tiny, for use in very close quarters (like site sponsorships etc.).
