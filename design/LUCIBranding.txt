Here are the people who I want to be served by the website:

* General Public
	** Media that can help promote our work
	** Prospective graduate students that are researching where to go to grad
	school
	** Prospective undergraduates that are researching where to go to grad
	school

* Lab Members	
	** Faculty in the ICS school
	** Grad students in ICS
	** Undergrad students in ICS

* External Researchers
	** External Faculty
	** External Grad Students




* Things I want on the website:
	* A description of the administrative structure of the school and the lab
		This is confusing and needs to be clarified for people
	* A list of research areas and what is going on with each piece.
	* A list of recent publications by people affiliated with the lab
		This is mostly for P.R. purposes
	* A Data Repository 
		This will also have papers associated with them.  Those papers which
		used the data in the repository.
		This data might be submitted by external researchers.
		There should be a part of this that can be editted by people
		independently like a wiki.  But the data itself needs to be secure from
		that.
	* Bios of lab members
	* Lab news, local awards, local events, local speakers, local calendars etc.
	* World news relevant to ubiquitous computing.  Probably blog format.
		 Submitted by lots of contributers.
	* A list of conferences and deadlines associated with them
