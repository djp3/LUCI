<p> In the late 1980s, <a href="asfunction:_root.jumpToURLNewWindow,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Weiser">Mark Weiser</a> coined the term "ubiquitous computing" to name the emerging <a href="asfunction:_root.jumpToURLNewWindow,http://www.ubiq.com/hypertext/weiser/UbiHome.html">third era of computing</a>. The first era was the era of mainframe computing: large, powerful computers shared by many people. The second era was the era of personal computing: a computer per person. In the third era of ubiquitous computing, we will each have tens or hundreds of computers -- not just on our desktop, but computers that we carry with us, computers that we wear, and computers that are embedded in our world. These computers gracefully leave the offices and research labs and move into the larger, uncontrolled, everyday world of people.  </p>
<p> LUCI, the Laboratory for Ubiquitous Computing and Interaction, serves as a focal point for research that follows from this vision. Our group of researchers are interested in the challenges of designing, using, and understanding the elements of a ubiquitous computing world.  Some of these different facets include computing in the face of mobile computers and mobile users, understanding and exploring new patterns of socio-technical behavior, and the design and construction of technology which supports ubiquitous computing.  </p>
<p> Administratively, LUCI exists in the <a href="asfunction:_root.jumpToURLNewWindow,http://www.ics.uci.edu/informatics">Department of Informatics</a>, a department in the <a href="asfunction:_root.jumpToURLNewWindow,http://www.ics.uci.edu">Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences</a> at the <a href="asfunction:_root.jumpToURLNewWindow,http://www.uci.edu">University of California at Irvine</a>.  We are physically <a href="asfunction:_root.jumpToURLNewWindow,http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=East+Peltason+Dr.+and+Campus+Dr.,+Irvine+CA&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=33.64778,-117.83527&amp;spn=25.661802,64.467773&amp;t=h&amp;om=1">located in Irvine,</a> between Los Angeles and San Diego, in beautiful Southern California, USA.  Our new facility, which will be located in the <a href="asfunction:_root.jumpToURLNewWindow,http://www.ics.uci.edu/about/brenhall/brenhall_webcam.php">new Bren Hall</a>, opens January 2007.  </p>
