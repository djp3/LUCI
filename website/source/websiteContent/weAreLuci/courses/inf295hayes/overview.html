<span><p>Special topics in Informatics</p>
<p>Surveillance, Sousveillance, and the Use and Abuse of Recording Technology</p>
<p>This seminar course will focus on discussions of recording technologies and their impacts on society. Readings will cover topics as broad as reality television, performance art, homeland security, and consumer targeting and data mining of consumer data. We will examine the problem from theoretical, design-oriented, and technical viewpoints. Students should expect to complete required and optional readings, present these readings in class, and participate actively in discussions each week. Two papers or an approved research project in the area will make up half the grade with discussion and participation making up the other half. Invited speakers may also come and join the class from the arts, humanities, criminology, and outside the university.</p>
