<span><p>Graduate Program Guidelines: Last updated 9/15/2008</p> <p>The Informatics faculty are currently drafting up more comprehensive guidance on requirements for various stages of the graduate program.  In the meantime, here are some guidelines for the Phase II and advancement to candidacy exam for students in the UBICOMP and General track.  Please address feedback to your advisor who can forward updates to this page.</p>
<p><b>Scheduling the Phase II</b>: In an attempt to get a handle on the turn around time for completing the Phase II exam, the faculty are adhering to the following schedule: In the quarter in which a student wishes to submit their Phase II exam, they must submit their paper to their entire committee by 5pm on the Friday of the 3rd full week of classes.  The faculty will respond with reviews by the end of the 5th week of classes.  Possible outcomes are a failure (one retry is allowed), a major revision is required, a minor revision is required and a pass.  Students then have until the end of the 6th week to complete revisions as appropriate and the committee will assess the revisions by the end of the 7th week.  The result will either be a failure or permission to schedule the advancement to candidacy exam.  </p>
<p><b>What is the Phase II evaluating?</b>: The committee is evaluating the student's paper writing ability, current research quality, and future research potential.  The content should be at the level of a decent conference paper, but the paper should be extended to a more journal-like exposition, one that draws out more of the conceptual contributions, and pays a greater attention to related work. Think of it as journal paper in style.</p>
<p><b>Advancement to Candidacy Exam</b>:  The advancement to candidacy exam is an oral presentation of the Phase II paper in front of the student's committee.  The presentation is approximately 40 minutes.  After the presentation the committee will ask the student questions which relate a reading list to the student's work in order to assess the student's understanding of their work in relation to the existing academic literature.  The result of the advancement to candidacy exam can be fail, terminal pass (Master's degree), and pass.</p></span>
