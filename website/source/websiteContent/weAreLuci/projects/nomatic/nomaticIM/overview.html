<span><b>Nomatic*IM: Overview</b> 

<p> Nomatic*IM provides a service that supports the convenient, and appropriate broadcasting of presence through instant messagin clients.  It provides the flexibility to support multiple IM protocols, IM clients, and operating systems.</p>
<p> From a high-level, what Nomatic*IM does is to figure out where you are and what you are doing from the sensors that come with your computing platform.  That information is processed with machine learning techniques to develop a semantic interpretation about the name of your current place, activity and social context.  Although we can sometimes figure out your latitude and longitude, we are not primarily interested in that.  We are interested in what you <b>name</b> your current place and activity.  </p> 
<p> If Nomatic*IM can make a good guess about where you are, we report that in the status line of your IM client.  The result is that the people on your buddy list can see where you are and what you are doing - as you describe it.  </p> 
<p> Why are we doing this?  A thorough elaboration can be found in our white paper located <a href="asfunction:_root.jumpToURLNewWindow,http://www.springerlink.de/openurl.asp?genre=article&amp;id=doi:10.1007/11752967_13">here</a>.  The short answer, though, is that computing is changing.  It is becoming a part of our daily landscape.  When IM was first created the use of an indicator that said online/offline or available/not-available made sense.  But now that IM is available on cell-phones, and laptops, a binary description of availability is beginning to fail us.  If we are always online, which we believe future computing will enable, how can we communicate availability to our social tribe?  Our approach is to automatically interpret the context of an IM user and communicate that information to a user's buddy list.  This enables people to make a complicated social decision with technological support.  </p> </span>
