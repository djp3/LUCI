<span><b>Nomatic (for presence): Overview</b> 

<p> Nomatic (for presence) is a context-aware instant messaging (IM) architecture, that works with all major IM protocols on all major operating systems through a plug-in architecture.  Although clients can be built on any IM platform, most of the reference code is based on the open-source project <a href="asfunction:_root.jumpToURLNewWindow,http://www.pidgin.im/">pidgin</a> (formerly gaim), which we have augmented with the ability to communicate to our presence management service.  </p> 
<p> From a high-level, what Nomatic (for presence) does is to figure out where you are and what you are doing from the sensors that come with your computing platform.  That information is reported to a central server which utilizes the latest machine learning techniques to develop a semantic interpretation about the name of your current place, activity and social context.  We are not primarily interested in your latitude and longitude, although we capture that, we *are* interested in what you name your current place and activity.  </p> 
<p> If Nomatic (for presence) can make a good guess about where you are, then we report that in the status line of your IM client.  The result is that the people on your buddy list can see where you are and what you are doing - as you describe it.  </p> 
<p> Why are we doing this?  A thorough elaboration can be found in our white paper located <a href="asfunction:_root.jumpToURLNewWindow,http://www.springerlink.de/openurl.asp?genre=article&amp;id=doi:10.1007/11752967_13">here</a>.  The short answer, though, is that computing is changing.  It is becoming a part of our daily landscape.  When IM was first created the use of an indicator that said online/offline or available/not-available made sense.  But now that IM is available on cell-phones, and laptops, a binary description of availability is beginning to fail us.  If we are always online, which we believe future computing will enable, how can we communicate availability to our social tribe?  Our approach is to automatically interpret the context of an IM user and communicate that information to a user's buddy list.  This enables people to make a complicated social decision with technological support.  </p> </span>
