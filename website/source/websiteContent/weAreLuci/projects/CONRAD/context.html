<span><b>Context</b>


<p>By integrating Nomatic, our context discovery project, CONRAD can display useful information in office buildings to visitors.  Using Nomatic, location, activity, and social context of office personal can be monitored and sent to a centralized server.  CONRAD allows for visualization of this context outside offices belonging to the person.  Outside of a person's office, a visitor will be able to tell if the person is in their office, currently busy, with other people, or a location elsewhere in the building they may find them.</p>
<p> The Context application for CONRAD is focused on providing status information of an office's occupant that is relevant for visitors in the situation they need it most - upon arriving at the personnel's office.  Without CONRAD, office occupants usually leave their doors open, indicating that visitors are welcome.  By showing their location status on a CONRAD display outside their office, they may keep their door closed, offering additional privacy and noise buffering.  Visitors to the office will also not need to stand outside knocking, unsure if an occupant is busy, if the CONRAD display indicates that the occupant is out.  Finally, if Nomatic indicates to CONRAD that an occupant is elsewhere in the building (like a break room) and willing to receive visitors, the display can direct them to the new room.</p>
<p> By allowing office personnel to indicate their activities &amp; social status on displays outside their offices, visitors can determine if interruption is appropriate or if they should wait.  Knowing that others are in the office or that a conference call is going on helps eliminate many current office faux pas, and improves awareness of what is going on in the building for employees.</p>
