<span><b>Navigation</b>

<p> The navigation application for CONRAD is designed to direct new visitors to destinations from a centralized kiosk.  When a visitor enters the building, a kiosk at the entrance displays the building's directory.  By selecting the room, office, person, or event (currently running that day), the kiosk will indicate the location of that place/activity on the floor plan and assign the user a colored arrow.  CONRAD then coordinates all the displays in the building to point the direction to the destination using arrows of the assigned color.  In this way, visitors can easily navigate to their destinations without knowing the building's structure or floor plan.</p>
<p>The CONRAD navigation system is also very dynamic.  Event planners can easily add their events to the system for display on the central kiosk.  This eliminates the need for printing &amp; posting of specialized signs for events.  Attendees can see the list of events easily when they enter the building, and be directed to their location.  The system easily adapts as events are moved, added, and canceled.  Visitors to the building additionally get a sense of what is currently going on through the kiosk event interface.</p>
<p>Navigation on CONRAD also removes the need for visitors to remember room numbers, instead focusing on the information they care about - the name of the person, office, or event they are looking for.  By selecting a person's name, they system directs them to their office.  This also allows the Navigation application to adjust to personal moves in office buildings etc, eliminating confusion when offices move.</p>
<p>Finally, if visitors get lost, or wish to return to a central location in order to find another destination, simply pushing a button on CONRAD will direct arrows returning to the centralized kiosk.</p>
