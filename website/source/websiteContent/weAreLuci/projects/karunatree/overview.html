<span><p><a href="asfunction:_root.jumpToURLNewWindow,http://www.karunatree.com">Karuna Tree</a><br/>by Assistant Project Scientist Derek Lyons, Professor Bill Tomlinson<br/><br/>KarunaTree is an interactive narrative world for children, designed to help them to understand and respond to the serious environmental challenges that face our planet. Accessible through a standard web browser, children interact with KarunaTree as a kind of evolving multimedia storybook â€” one in which their decisions and real-world environmental actions shape the trajectory of the emerging plot. This feedback between real-world action and the story world is key, as our goal is to do more than simply educate children about sustainability; rather, we hope to empower children to assert control over their own environmental future, to cultivate the habits of thought, behavior, and communication that are needed for meaningful global change.</p>

In addition to regular project status updates, the blog will feature ongoing discussion of how interactive media can contribute to children\'s learning and sociocognitive development.</p></span>
