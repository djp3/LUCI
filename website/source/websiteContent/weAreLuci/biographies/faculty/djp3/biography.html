<b><font size='16'>Biography</font></b>

	Don Patterson is an Assistant Professor in the <a href="asfunction:_root.jumpToURLNewWindow,http://www.ics.uci.edu/informatics/">Informatics Department</a> in the <a href="asfunction:_root.jumpToURLNewWindow,http://www.ics.uci.edu">Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences</a> at the <a href="asfunction:_root.jumpToURLNewWindow,http://www.uci.edu">University of California at Irvine</a>.

	He grew up mostly in Virginia, went to <a href="asfunction:_root.jumpToURLNewWindow,http://www.tjhsst.edu/">Thomas Jefferson High School for Science &amp; Technology</a>, then <a href="asfunction:_root.jumpToURLNewWindow,http://www.cornell.edu">Cornell University</a> to study Computer Science (B.S.) and Electrical Engineering (M.Eng).  He spent some time in the Navy on the <a href="asfunction:_root.jumpToURLNewWindow,http://www.curtis-wilbur.navy.mil/index.htm">USS CURTIS WILBUR (DDG-54)</a> stationed in Japan and the <a href="asfunction:_root.jumpToURLNewWindow,http://navysite.de/ships/as33.htm">USS SIMON LAKE (AS-33)</a> stationed in Italy.  He went to grad school in the <a href="asfunction:_root.jumpToURLNewWindow,http://www.cs.washington.edu">University of Washington's Department of Computer Science and Engineering</a>. 

	While there, he was an <a href="asfunction:_root.jumpToURLNewWindow,http://www.asee.org/ndseg/">NDSEG</a> fellow and did research on <a href="asfunction:_root.jumpToURLNewWindow,http://www.cs.washington.edu/ai/">artificial intelligence</a> and its application to <a href="asfunction:_root.jumpToURLNewWindow,http://www.cs.washington.edu/assistcog/">Alzheimer's Disease</a> management and <a href="asfunction:_root.jumpToURLNewWindow,http://bio.cs.washington.edu/">DNA biotechnology</a>.  He was an intern at <a href="asfunction:_root.jumpToURLNewWindow,http://www.intel-research.net">Intel Research Seattle</a>. His primary advisors were <a href="asfunction:_root.jumpToURLNewWindow,http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/kautz/">Henry Kautz</a> and <a href="asfunction:_root.jumpToURLNewWindow,http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/fox/">Dieter Fox</a> with whom he worked on the Activity Compass also known as "<a href="asfunction:_root.jumpToURLNewWindow,http://springerlink.metapress.com/content/xh22c1262bny1fly/?p=fbea5318762a422292ce51ad0eade635&pi=25">Opportunity Knocks</a>."

	His current research interests focus on context-aware computing and how to make a computer operate appropriately when it leaves the office and moves into the greater world: Ubiquitous computing meets Artificial Intelligence meets Human-Computer Interaction.
