<span><b>Temporality and Rhythms: Overview</b>

<p>John Archibald Wheeler once joked, "Time is what stops everything from happening at once." Just as temporality is central to our experience of the world, it is also central to collaboration and our interactions with others. People are creatures of habit. Every day, we arrive at work in the morning by a certain time, take our lunch break at the same hour, and go home at roughly the same time in the evening. While many people are aware of this basic daily temporal pattern, they may not be aware of other temporal regularities that often occur in their day-to-day lives, patterns that occur on both a larger scale over a long period of time and micro-patterns that occur within a day.</p>
<p>When we interact with other people, much of our interaction is built around the convergence of each other/s rhythms. We would like to explore this interaction further. Specifically, we are investigating temporal patterns in the context of being online and using instant messaging programs. How does the knowledge of someone's IM rhythms affect the way you interact, coordinate, and collaborate with that person? What is the effect of this awareness on communication effectiveness?</p>
<p>Our system calculates the probability that your instant messaging buddies will be online at a specific time of day, based on their past behavior, and displays it as a graph over a time axis. We also introduce an element of comparison by allowing these graphs to layer upon themselves to form a larger image so you can see your own contribution within a larger group. We hope to study these patterns and explore how they might change over time, and in turn, how people might change their own rhythms with respect to others.</p></span>
