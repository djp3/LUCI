<span><p>The bulk of ambient display work has focused on ambient displays as peripheral, rather than focal, sources of information. Moving information off the computer screen, ambient displays have often gone hand in hand with tangible interfaces.</p>
<p> We wish to move beyond the dichotomy of peripheral and focal, a metaphor based on foveal vision. Rather than display information to be consumed by the eyes and the brain, we are interested in supporting a different kind of knowledge, embedded socially and physically in one's environment.</p>
<p> We build ambient displays in space. We understand space to be produced by embodied social actors. To quote Doreen Massey, we think of places as "articulate moments in networks of social relations and understandings", and as such they are processes rather than things. We mean our systems to be part of the process of place.</p>
<p>We build systems that:</p>
<li>Articulate social action in space, not only by individuals, but aggregating action in a way that highlights the community.</li> <li>Are open to interpretation.</li> <li>Are known over time and by moving around the space.</li> <li>Are understood by observing each other's actions both directly and through the system.</li></span>
