<br/>
<br/>	Eric Kabisch is an artist, interaction designer, and doctoral candidate in the Department of Informatics at the University of California, Irvine. His current practice is concerned with the varied intersections between geospatial information technologies and human geography. Eric is developing a framework for analyzing the cyclical process by which information technologies measure, represent and embed themselves into society and our world. He constructs cultural artifacts which utilize custom software systems, DIY construction and usually emit some form of sound. Through the creation of these artifacts he hopes to reconsider the process of design, enabling novel forms of use by avoiding traditional evaluative models such as efficiency and utility. Eric's previous education includes an MFA in Arts Computation Engineering (UCI), a BA in Telecommunications and Music from Indiana University, and an A.S. in Audio Technology (IU). He has professional experience in interaction design, game programming, and art direction.</span>
