<br/>	<P>I am a Sophomore at UCI double majoring in Mechanical and Electrical Engineering. I love to tinker with anything tinkerable, especially paintball marker pneumatics, computer hardware, and anything with a motor. I want to make it faster, more efficient, and simple. I believe function following form should be a prosecutable offense, and that timeless technical beauty flows from an indiscriminate philosophy of design that embraces a post-human condition of success - to create anything less fulfilling of the highest conceivable notion of perfection at the time of design is to fail. I find it hard to stick to tried and true design concepts conceptually when pondering a project, what fun is emulation?</P>
<br/><p>I am currently working on Garnet Hertz's Out Run project concerning the mechanical and electrical fusion of the vehicle and the system, emphasizing the consistency between the controls and a design that is modular and fluid. I work closely with Matthew Wong on this aspect of the project.</p>
<br/><p>I am attempting to utilize this project as a testament to my inherent desire to seed out interesting design concepts that are pertinent to creating a cleaner, funner (yes, funner), more efficient world. I am interested in next-generation automotive technology emphasizing impeccable performance and impregnable safety features (such as passively conscious cars). I am also very interested in artificial intelligence and its application in robotics and cybernetics with its ability to turn the keyboard, as it were, on us.</p>
<br/><p>I look forward to an employment career at a number of prospective companies/industries, such as Formula 1 (perhaps for the newly approved USF1 team), University research departments involved with implementing feasible Hydrogen IC engines, and Defense Contractors such as Lockheed Martin's Skunkworks. Currently I hope to attain a PhD in one of the many realms mentioned.</p>
