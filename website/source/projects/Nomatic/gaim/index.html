    <li>Privacy principles:
      <ul>
        <li>These principles apply, unless you are using this software under the auspices of an approved Human Subjects research study which has obtained your written consent to break them. </li>
        <li>We obtain consent through opt-in questions. </li>
        <li>We never reveal your exact latitude and longitude without your explicit consent every time we do it. </li>
        <li>We never reveal your &quot;place&quot; without first letting you know under what circumstances it is revealed and then getting your explicit approval for those circumstances. </li>
        <li>Your data belongs to you:
          <ul>
            <li>You may delete your data from our database at any time. </li>
            <li>You may anonymize your old data at any time. This will leave your old data in the database, but disassociate that data from you.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not keep track of, store, or know whose data belongs to whom. We require your assistance in order to do anything to your data:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>When you submit place data to our database it is stored with an anonymous code. That anonymous code is based on your Nomatic*Gaim registration, but we cannot determine which anonymous code came from  which Nomatic*Gaim registration. (Tech note: This is accomplished with a one-way hash called md5sum) </li>
        <li>Even information that contains your anonymous code is not released without your consent. </li>
        <li>If our database is stolen or subpeoned your anonymous code is still fundamentally not traceable back to you unless:
          <ul>
            <li>someone has obtained a copy of our database *and* you reveal your anonymous code to someone in a different way. Here are some ways that might happen:
                <ul>
                  <li>You give your registration name and password to someone else. That information can be used to generate your anonymous code. </li>
                  <li>Rather than submitting place information, you enter information  like &quot;I am Joe Doughnut&quot; into the database. Doing such a thing would increase the chances that the anonymous code associated with &quot;I am Joe Doughnut&quot; came from Joe Doughnut. </li>
                  <li>You enter information like &quot;home&quot; into the place database and someone can figure out who lives at that location. Then the anonymous code associated with the &quot;home&quot; entry is more likely to belong to the person that lives there. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
